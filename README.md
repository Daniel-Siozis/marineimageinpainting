This web application is designed to repair damaged underwater images using a trained TensorFlow-Keras model. Users can upload an image by browsing their files or using drag & drop, after which the image is processed and displayed. Once the "Repair" button is clicked, the repaired image will be shown below.

On the left side of the web application, there is a menu that can be toggled. This menu allows users to navigate between the Home page (where damaged images can be uploaded and repaired), the Documentation section (providing detailed information about our project), and the "About Us" section (offering information about the project participants).
